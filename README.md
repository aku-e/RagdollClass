# RagdollClass
 A class that allows you to create togglable ragdolls with ease.

## How to use
 - [Install Rojo if you haven't already!](https://rojo.space)
 
 Clone this repository to your directory of choice, now navigate to the directory using your terminal of choice, and type in "rojo serve".
 In Roblox Studio now press connect in the rojo plugin (specify port if necessary).
 You should now see the RagdollClass module in ReplicatedStorage. 

## Documentation
 - [Documentation](https://github.com/aku-e/RagdollClass/blob/master/docs)
 
 I feel like it is important enough to mention: RagdollClass does not handle replication.
 It has support for replication, however it is up to you how you want to implement it.
 In the [examples](https://github.com/aku-e/RagdollClass/blob/master/docs/examples) folder you can see how you can implement replication so that everyone can see your ragdolls.

## Avatar Support
 This supports both R6 and R15.

## Credits
 The actual ragdoll code itself was made by Quenty.
 I use an maid class created by Quenty.
 You can find a link to the original code in the source files.
